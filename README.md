ShareGenerator.java takes an image file as input and generates 2 shares privateshare.png, and publicshare.png and can also rejoin them to make originalshare.png

## Unzipping The folder

- To use the project, unzip the contents of the ZIP/RAR file and run ShareGenerator.java (Before opening a Java Project make sure the Latest Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are installed and recognize this folder as a Java Project). 

## Running ShareGenerator.java

- There are two statements inside ShareGenerator.java, The first line generates Private and Public Shares from an orginal image (Enter the name of the image in place of "fingerprint.png"). The Second line recreates the Original Image from the Private and Public Shares.

- Activate the statement which is to be used and #comment# out the one which is to be excluded.

- The Program CAN run both generateShares() and generateOrginal() at once.
